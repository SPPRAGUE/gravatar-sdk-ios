# credentials never land in the repo checkout.
#
# The compiled file comes from one of two sources, in order:
#
#   1. The a8c-secrets decrypted tree, for internal contributors. The phase runs
#      the decrypt command itself so that secrets are always up to date, and
#      fails the build when it can't.
#   2. Demo/Demo/Secrets.external-contributors.swift — gitignored, so external
#      contributors can copy Demo/Demo/Secrets.template.swift there and add
#      their credentials there with little-to-no-risk of them leaking.
